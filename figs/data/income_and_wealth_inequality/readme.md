Note: This figure depicts the annual real pre-tax income growth per adult for each percentile in the 1946â€“1980 period (in blue) and 1980-2018 period (in red). From 1946 to 1980, growth was evenly distributed with all income groups growing at the average 2 percent annual rate (except the top 1 percent which grew slower). From 1980 to 2018, growth has been unevenly distributed with low growth for bottom income groups, mediocre growth for the middle class, and explosive growth at the top.
